## Overview

In PoolTogether V5 prizes are awarded every "Draw". When a user wins a prize a transaction needs to be submitted to claim the prize before the next "Draw" occurs otherwise it will expire. The VRGDA Claimer is an incentivization mechanism the allows third parties to claim prizes on behalf of the prize winner for a fee.

- Prizes come from the Prize Pool.
- All depositors in Vaults that have contributed yield through a Liquidator recently are elgigible to win a prize.

Anyone may capture fees by claiming prizes through the Claimer contract.  The claimer contract will price fees according to a VRGDA algorithm.  The fees for the two canary tiers are always set to the prize size; meaning that the claimers can capture the whole prize.

## Development

### Installation

You may have to install the following tools to use this repository:

- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) to compile and test contracts
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to handle environment variables
- [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) to generate the code coverage report

Install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

### Env

Copy `.envrc.example` and write down the env variables needed to run this project.

```
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

Once your env variables are setup, load them with:

```
direnv allow
```

### Compile

Run the following command to compile the contracts:

```
npm run compile
```

### Coverage

Forge is used for coverage, run it with:

```
npm run coverage
```

You can then consult the report by opening `coverage/index.html`:

```
open coverage/index.html
```

### Code quality

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is used to run [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and tests when committing.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used to format TypeScript and Solidity code. Use it by running:

```
npm run format
```

[Solhint](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/) is used to lint Solidity files. Run it with:

```
npm run hint
```

### Tests

Test names including `SLOW` will be skipped on default test runs and need to be explicitly run.

### CI

A default Github Actions workflow is setup to execute on push and pull request.

It will build the contracts and run the test coverage.

You can modify it here: [.github/workflows/coverage.yml](.github/workflows/coverage.yml)

For the coverage to work, you will need to setup the `MAINNET_RPC_URL` repository secret in the settings of your Github repository.
